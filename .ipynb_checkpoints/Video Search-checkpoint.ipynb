       "\"\\ntime:0 hello everyone and welcome to a time:2 brilliant attacking game from round time:4 three of this year's singfield cup it is time:6 Yanni pishi versus Anish giri both of time:8 them coming off of two draws nepo Drew time:10 against Maxim and gukesh and Anish Drew time:13 against Wesley and Ding and this game time:16 like I said it has zero regard for King time:19 safety it's it's a beautiful attacking time:21 game and it's uh well uh not seen very time:25 often at this level so let's check it time:27 out NEPA with white opens with Pawn D4 time:31 we have Knight to F6 by Anish Pawn to C4 time:33 E6 Knight to C3 and Bishop to B4 okay so time:37 it's an nzo Indian defense obviously we time:39 are in for retreat uh E3 the the time:42 standard or the normal line we have time:43 castles and pawn to A3 Bishop captures time:46 and B captures seen a million times we time:49 have Pawn to D6 and pawn to F3 and now time:53 Knight to C6 there is there are a couple time:56 of other moves that have reached this time:58 position or a couple of other games for time:60 example Sam Shanklin had it against ler time:62 Dominguez this year in the American Cup time:65 and Dominguez won very nicely with Pawn time:67 to E5 but here we have Knight to C6 and time:70 it is now as of move seven that we have time:72 a completely new game uh we have Pawn to time:74 E4 grabbing the full Center and queen to time:77 E8 we have Pawn to H4 Pawn to B6 and time:81 each want to get to the light Square time:82 Bishop uh or maybe even bring it all the time:84 way to A6 to put pressure on that C4 time:86 Pawn uh which is usually a Target um time:89 when playing playing against when when time:90 playing the NSO Indian defense Pawn to time:93 H5 Bishop to A6 we have Rook to A2 and time:97 Knight to A5 going after the C4 Pawn but time:99 nepo just plays Pawn to G4 and you can time:102 see that the time on the clock for both time:105 of them is pretty similar hour 45 time:107 minutes hour and 44 minutes and here time:110 Anish goes Queen to C6 he could capture time:113 on C4 right away with something like time:115 let's say Bishop captures and after time:116 Bishop captures Knight captures you just time:118 bring the Rook into the attack Rook G2 time:121 and that's Neo's plan he just wants to time:122 play G5 and G6 um maybe even at the cost time:126 of a pawn maybe some tall like sacrifice time:129 with G5 G6 captures and H6 to maybe open time:132 up the H file all depending on how Anish time:134 defends but Anish plays Queen to C6 time:137 brings another piece into the attack and time:140 now if he trades for example captures time:142 and captures he will already have a very time:144 strong Queen on C4 but nepo continues time:146 with his plan Rook to G2 and Anish time:149 captures and C E4 so Bishop captures time:151 Bishop captures and queen captures going time:154 after the C3 pawn and Knight to E2 now time:157 if I told you that this was a game time:159 between nepo and the Nish without time:160 telling you uh who who's playing with time:163 with which color just seeing the pawn time:165 structure in front of nepo king of time:167 course you know who's playing with white time:168 here uh Knight to D7 Anish uh invest time:172 some 10 minutes on this move uh as it's time:176 very very hard to make a move with black time:178 but of course you know that those pawns time:179 are coming forward forward and you want time:181 uh to get the Knight away from there and time:184 have your kingside pawns uh as flexible time:186 as possible so Pawn to G5 we have Pawn time:189 to E5 and pawn to G6 just going straight time:193 for anisha's king and the question is time:195 how to defend here well Anish played F time:197 captures on G6 H6 looks very very time:200 interesting uh but it just doesn't look time:202 uh something a human would play like time:204 Bishop captures on H6 Pawn captures and time:207 queen to C1 uh looks very very very time:210 tough to defend like King G7 captures time:212 with check King captures Queen captures time:214 on H6 maybe you can defend this uh you time:217 know an engine will defend it but I mean time:219 to to Rooks a queen a pass Pawn already time:222 on H5 doesn't look very pleasant you time:224 have to start running away with your time:226 King right away uh and okay maybe maybe time:229 that way you escape or even better after time:231 King to d8 Rook to G7 but still you just time:233 Escape King to d8 and the the king time:236 escapes so it is possible to play like time:239 this like I said not not a very human time:241 thing to do F captures on G6 H captures time:243 and now Rook captures on F3 we have G time:247 captures on H7 with check King to h8 and time:249 now Rook H to G1 going after the G7 Pawn time:253 uh Rook to F7 defending and now at the time:256 move from the thumbnail I think this is time:258 the most beautiful move of the game as time:260 it allows uh it's not a winning move or time:262 anything it just allows nepo to remain time:264 in the game and keep the position very time:266 very complicated because if you play time:268 something weird uh well once Rook eight time:271 f8 lands there's no there are no more time:274 problems for black and black will be the time:275 one playing for the win here but after time:277 Bishop to H6 uh it it is no longer time:279 possible you you cannot play a rook Rook time:282 a to f8 now if you play this just Bishop time:284 captures on G7 and you resign King time:286 captures Rook to H2 check King Jon Rook time:288 to h8 will be Checkmate or any of the of time:291 the possible lines so G captures an H6 time:294 is anish's only defense G captures an H6 time:297 and now Rook to G8 with check cannot time:300 capture uh otherwise just H captures on time:303 G8 uh well Queen wins the game so King time:306 captures on H7 and now Rook captures on time:308 A8 and the question is how to continue time:311 here objectively it's still equal with time:314 Queen to C6 putting pressure on e4 and time:316 on The Rook you are still very much in time:318 the game but Anish goes after the E4 time:320 Pawn this way he plays Knight to F6 and time:323 now D captures on E5 Knight captures on time:326 e4 and queen to C1 and after Queen to C1 time:330 there's just uh nothing more for Anish time:333 to do here it's uh the C3 Pawn is time:335 defended but that is the least of your time:337 concerns uh the do you see the threat time:341 with with Queen to C1 that's the that's time:343 the idea it's it's a fairly time:344 straightforward one but just just for time:346 fun let's say Knight to B3 is played time:348 because it wasn't how do you win it's time:350 actually a force check made in four uh time:352 so have have at it while I give you a time:353 couple of seconds time:360 uh the move is of course uh Rook to h8 time:362 check you just clear the path for the time:365 White Queen to capture on H6 and that's time:367 it King captures Queen captures an H6 time:369 Rook to H7 only move now you deliver a time:371 check here and once the queen blocks time:373 Queen captures or Rook captures is time:375 Checkmate so after this queen to C1 move time:377 an each play Knight to G5 cutting off time:379 the Queen's um uh reach towards the H6 time:384 Pawn but it doesn't matter it is uh well time:387 only only a mild setback if you capture time:389 which of course um it was not played time:391 Just Queen captures and you get checkm time:393 checkmated however you play this there's time:395 not even a move that black can make that time:397 makes sense like the position is just so time:399 bad let's say bring another Defender time:401 into the game let's say queen H5 check time:403 now if you play Queen H6 again Rook to time:405 h8 just wins if you play King to G7 now time:407 Queen to h8 check and it's just a very time:410 very clean King hunt let's say King F5 time:413 Knight to G3 with check King to F4 Queen time:416 to H4 check let's say King E3 and queen time:418 to E4 will be Checkmate or or any any time:421 well line pretty much uh is the same so time:425 Anish tries Queen to H4 with check he time:427 will at least pick up the Rook on A8 but time:429 you know it will do him little good Rook time:432 to G3 as The Rook could not be captured time:434 Queen to H1 check Rook to G1 attacking time:437 the queen and the queen now grabs The time:439 Rook on A8 but now it's time for nepo to time:441 finish the attack Queen to C2 with check time:444 also B1 was possible uh King to h8 and time:447 queen to G6 and there is no defense uh time:450 Queen to f8 was played guarding the H6 time:452 Pawn H but now even though okay you time:455 could still make a mistake let's say time:456 play something like Rook to H1 Rook to time:457 H7 and there there's nothing if you now time:460 play Rook to F1 you can just play Queen time:462 to E7 and black defends but after Queen time:464 to f8 uh Pawn to E6 and this is crucial time:467 as it takes control over the F7 Square time:470 Rook to E7 but now Rook to H1 time:473 threatening Rook captures on H6 on each time:475 defense and only now Rook to F1 time:478 attacking the queen and now if you go time:480 Queen to E7 then Rook to F7 just wins so time:482 Queen to d8 and still Rook to F7 we have time:486 Rook captures e captures and there is time:488 nothing more to be done here Queen to f8 time:490 defending the the H6 pawn queen to F6 time:493 check King to H7 and here comes the time:496 Executioner Knight to F4 and he was in time:498 this position on move 37 that Anish giri time:501 resigned the game as there is nothing time:503 more to be done here uh a few more moves time:506 and its Checkmate however you play it time:507 just to give you an example let's say time:509 Knight to C4 or whatever really just time:511 Knight to E6 The Black Queen has no time:513 squares like play Queen h8 but now Queen time:515 F5 is just Checkmate uh so yeah uh time:518 really really awesome stuff by neppo time:520 featured some very very cool moves like time:522 The Rook Li Rook A2 uh let's let's speed time:525 through it just uh really quickly like a time:528 standard Nimo Indian defense uh with time:530 this Rook to A2 idea by nepo giving up time:533 the C4 Pawn which is uh yeah I don't time:535 know if you're an NSU Indian player or time:537 you play if you play against the NSU time:538 Indian some times you prefer not to have time:540 your queenside pawns doubled maybe with time:542 a move like Queen Queen to C2 uh but time:546 it's um you know it's almost never a time:548 good idea to go after it with black even time:550 though it's it's kind of the main idea time:552 when you're playing Black like you will time:553 have a very strong uh setup the the pawn time:556 will fall but I mean yeah it will but time:559 also this could happen uh like that's time:561 what I mean I mean this Rook Rook to A2 time:563 Rook to G2 maneuver absolutely beautiful time:566 advancing of the pawns uh clearing of time:568 the of the open H file and then uh time:571 something with this bishop to H6 wow I time:575 mean beautiful beautiful stuff and then time:578 Anisha still could fight back but he time:580 allowed nepo to to to go on the king time:583 hunt and that was pretty much it time:585 beautiful beautiful game by nepo he also time:588 takes the lead alongside alza after this time:590 win uh the these are the standings after time:593 round three so ala and Neo with two time:595 points with one and a half Fab Wesley so time:598 Maxim pregnant and gash and ding Len and time:601 with one point nbe abdat and Anish giri time:605 as they have suffered some losses H so time:607 yeah that's the game hope you guys time:608 enjoyed it first game that we are time:609 covering from the singfield cup if you time:611 have any favorites use ash suggestion time:613 and I will gladly go over them I would time:615 like to thank Michael Bowers Carmen time:617 poono Robert stelman Jack miof and the time:619 gersy chess festival.org for your time:622 contribution to my channel thank you a time:623 lot I really appreciate it as usual you time:625 can check two of my previous videos here time:627 thank you for watching and I will see time:628 you
